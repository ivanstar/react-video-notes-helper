## Overview

Simultaneously stream lecture videos and take notes side by side. Each note comes with a timestamp so users
can indicate where exactly in the video each note is referring to. All it takes is a few simple steps: enter any video URL and click timestamp to checkpoint anywhere in the video
and it gets attached to the notes!
